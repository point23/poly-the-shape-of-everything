@fixme ### 
- ISSUE#001: 2d local position is limited
    change it from 2d to 3d
- ISSUE#002: Sth wrong with double-click:
    fire a scheduler to disable it after a very short interval.
- ISSUE#003: Failed to move onto entities just created in the editor...
- ISSUE#004: When 2 rover moves in different direction, and there's a entity in between, one of them would keep moving and stop at the same pos that entity locate.
- Fix undo redo
- Clean up undo
- ISSUE#006: When we push a rock, it falls to a wrong pos, if the rover is moved at the same time
- ISSUE#005: When we push a rock in the same round that rover is moved, them would be in the same square
- ISSUE#007: When we push sth, its supportee should be blocked by others and drop down
- ISSUE#008: When we push sth, its supportee may drop on a comming entity
- ISSUE#009: When we move gem onto switch in edit mode,
     then enter test run, then immediatly reload, it crashes caused by sth related to 'pending_win'.
- Clear transaction stack when load new levels
- Repeatedly bind the schedule function!!!
    just unschedule it when exit
- ISSUE#010: Supporting Stack!!!
    Boards are the FIRST CLASS supporter and supportee
    Boards should have at least one non-board supporter
    If supportee has other suppoter, it should not be moved.
- ISSUE#012: Undo -> Rewind
    When user keep pressing undo button, the gamecode should keep rewind, instead of undo once and start to generate
    rover moves immediatly... 
- ISSUE#011: ROVER NEEDS STATE
    After redo action, rover will recalculate it's next direction depends on track and its orientation
    Rover move is generated relies on this val [Game Round Id % Rover Speed], but since we didn't rewind the Round Id,
        it introduced a lot of inconsistencies. We can't reenact some behavior after undo, which is horrifying.
+ Look through occluding objects if there's a hero or special items like switch or gem
    - 2 shaders, one with ZTEST GEqual
+ Stop all of the tweens when doing undo, it is visually wrong.
+ Since gameplay timer is flip to 0 when count to 1 << 8, 2 rover move will be generate at 2 neighber rounds, each rover should has its own couter!!!

@optimize ###
+ Draw-Call is too high
