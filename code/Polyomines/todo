@deprecated ###
- Redo & Undo <= Command Pattern

@fixme ### 
- 2d local position is limited
    change it from 2d to 3d
- Sth wrong with double-click:
    fire a scheduler to disable it after a very short interval.
- Failed to move onto entities just created in the editor...
- Fix undo redo
- Check for supportor inside a falling move
- Transaction Panel is now doesn't work..
    since there are a lot of rover moves.
- Undo checkpoints:
    we should not count in those automatically generated moves
+ Clean up undo
+ Sanity check is in need!!!
    when we push a rock in the same round that rover is moved, them would be in the same square
+ Domino control
+ Clear transaction stack when load new level
+ Repeatedly bind the callback function!!!

@optimize ###
+ Draw-Call is too high
