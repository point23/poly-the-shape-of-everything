@fixme ###

    change it from 2d to 3d
- ISSUE#002: Sth wrong with double-click:
    fire a scheduler to disable it after a very short interval.
- ISSUE#003: Failed to move onto entities just created in the editor...
- Fix undo redo
+ Undo checkpoints:
    we should not count in those automatically generated moves
- Clean up undo
- ISSUE#006: When we push a rock, it falls to a wrong pos, if the rover is moved at the same time
- ISSUE#005: When we push a rock in the same round that rover is moved, them would be in the same square
- ISSUE#007: When we push sth, its supportee should be blocked by others and drop down
+ ISSUE#008: When we push sth, its supportee may drop on a comming entity
+ When 2 rover moves in different direction, and there's a entity in between, one of them would keep moving and stop at the same pos that entity locate.
+ Look through occluding objects if there's a hero or special items like switch or gem
+ Domino control
+ Clear transaction stack when load new levels
+ Repeatedly bind the callback function!!!

@optimize ###
